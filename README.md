AIMMBOT is an application that analyzes a user's movie ratings and uses this data to recommend unwatched movies.

Movie and user data have been sourced from the University of Minnesota's MovieLens database and are stored via Google Firebase.

UPDATE 11/26/23: This repository is no longer maintained and thus fetch requests from Firebase may fail.
